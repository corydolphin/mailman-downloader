#Olin's Mailman Archive Tools

This repository holds a collection of scripts and tools to access, parse and manage Olin's Mailman list archives. In particular, downloading the archives, parsing to mbox files and uploading over IMAP to Gmail, where they are full-text indexed (for free!), and searched over IMAP using the GMAIL-X attribute.

More documentation and explanations to come.
